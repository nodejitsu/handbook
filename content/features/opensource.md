Nodejitsu is committed to supporting the development of open source software.
That is why we extend a standing offer to the developer community to host open
source apps on [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com) for __free__.

To get started, please *make sure* your app is already deployed on
[Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). Then, fill out the information at
<http://opensource.jit.su> and tell us a little bit about yourself and your
project. We will get back to you as soon as your submission is received.
