## Why Open Source

Most of Nodejitsu's technology stack is released as open source software. We
choose to do this for many reasons. Aside from being able to give back to the
Node.js community, releasing pieces of our stack as open-source allows other
developers to review and improve our software. We've already received invaluable
contributions to our platform from developers who would have never seen our code
if we had not open-sourced it.

## Where To Find Our Projects

Nodejitsu hosts its open-source projects on [Github](https://github.com):

* *<https://github.com/nodejitsu>*: Open source components of Nodejitsu's PaaS
* *<https://github.com/flatiron>*: Nodejitsu's "anti-framework" for building web and cli applications
* *<https://github.com/nodeapps>*: A collection of node.js applications ready to use

Github is a web site for sharing and
collaborating on source code using [git](http://gitscm.org/), a popular version
control system. You can get our source code without creating an account at
github, and if you want to create an account it's free. You will need a 
[git client](http://git-scm.com/download) if you wish to clone any of our
code repositories.

## How To Contribute

Anyone can contribute to any of our open-source projects at any time.
Our [github site](https://github.com/nodejitsu) has the facilities for managing
patches, issues, code comments, version control, and just about anything else an
open source developer could need.
