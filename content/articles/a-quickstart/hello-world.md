In this tutorial, you will write a simple "hello world" web application in Node.js, and then deploy it using jitsu, Nodejitsu's command line interface. Before you get started, you should have [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki) installed.

## Write A Server

Let's start with a very basic Node.js http server. Create a folder called `myapp/` and then create a file inside the folder called `server.js`. Inside this file, write the following code:

``` js
  // requires node's http module
  var http = require('http');
      
  // creates a new httpServer instance
  http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    // this is the callback, or request handler for the httpServer
    
    // respond to the browser, write some headers so the 
    // browser knows what type of content we are sending
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
         
    // write some content to the browser that your user will see
    res.write('<h1>hello, i know nodejitsu.</h1>');
    
    // close the response
    res.end();
  }).listen(8080); // the server will listen on port 8080
```

That's all the code you'll need for starters. Save your server and get ready todeploy!

## Deploy with `jitsu`

In this tutorial, we will use [jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu) to deploy our "hello world" application. `jitsu` is a
[Command Line Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for using Nodejitsu's platform. We've designed jitsu to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.

If this is your first time deploying an application and you are eager to get started, we recommend using jitsu: it has a one line installer, it's self-documenting, and with it you'll be able to deploy your app in seconds. Plus, it's what's in the tutorial.

### Installation

In order to install jitsu, open a terminal and type:

```
  [sudo] npm install jitsu -g
````

This command will install jitsu on your system; the `-g` makes npm install it globally, rather than as a local module.

After installation, run the `jitsu` command from your command line. Since it's your first time using jitsu, you will be prompted to log in with an existing account or to create a new account.

**Once you've logged in, you can deploy your app immediately.**

### One Line Deployment

Open a terminal:

``` 
  cd /home/me/myapp
  jitsu deploy
```

This will create a new application snapshot, generate and/or update project metadata, and deploy the project in the current path to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). If it's your first deployment, you'll be prompted for some information such as *<u>your app's name</u>*, its  *<u>nodejitsu subdomain</u>*, and its *<u>start script</u>*. It's really easy and we promise it will  only take a few seconds.

```
  prompt: subdomain (myapp): myapp
  prompt: scripts.start (server.js): 
  prompt: version (0.0.0): 
``` 

Now just open up your favorite browser, and go to `myapp.nodejitsu.com`. If everything has been set up correctly, then you too, are on the path of nodejitsu!
