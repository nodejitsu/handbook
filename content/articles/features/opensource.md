Nodejitsu is committed to supporting the development of open source software. That's why we extend a standing offer to the developer community to host open source apps on [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com) for __free__.

First, please *make sure* your app is already deployed on [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). Then, fill out the information at <http://opensource.jit.su> and tell us about you and your project and we'll get back to you shortly.
