## Github Issues

Each of Nodejitsu's open source projects uses Github Issues to manage bugs and related software problems. Github Issues is most useful for developers. For example, if a developer finds a bug in our open-source [http proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy), they can submit an issue at <https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues> and tell us about their bug.
