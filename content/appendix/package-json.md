# Understanding the package.json format

A package.json file describes your application, its dependencies, and other
various application metadata. For a detailed spec on creating a package.json you
can check out Isaac's fine documentation
[here](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html). 

[package.json.jit.su](http://package.json.jit.su) is an interactive package.json
properties explorer! Highly recommended.

## Preparing a package.json for your application

Nodejitsu requires that you create a valid [package.json](#package_json) for
your application. The package.json will determine certain important pieces of
information about your application which are required for deployment. Since
sometimes it can get confusing when constructing your package.json file, we
provide wizards in our CLI tool and on our website for creating one. 

Here is an example of what your package.json might look like:

``` javascript
{
  "name": "hellonode",
  "subdomain": "hellonode",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "node": "v0.8.x"
  }
}
```

Notice the "scripts" property? This is where you'll store information about
specific scripts in your application. The "start" property indicates the script
that will get called when your application is started. Usage is compatible with
`npm start`.

And what about that "engines" property? Nodejitsu supports 
[multiple versions of node](/documentation/features/#feature/multi-node)

## Specifying dependencies in your package.json

If your application requires additional dependencies or third-party libraries,
Nodejitsu fully supports npm module dependency resolution. All you have to do is
list your dependencies the exact same way you would if you were packaging a
module for npm. Here is an example of the same package.json with a few
dependencies.

<a name="package_json"></a>
``` javascript
{
  "name": "hellonode",
  "subdomain": "hellonode",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "async": "0.1.x",
    "colors": "0.5.x",
    "request": "1.9.x"
  },
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "engines": {
    "node": "v0.8.x"
  }
}
```

Your dependencies will be resolved when your application deploys to Nodejitsu.

**TIP:** When installing your dependencies, use the `--save` flag like `npm
install --save flatiron` to add the dependencies and theirs versions to the
package.json

## Nodejitsu-Specific package.json Properties

A few package.json properties have special behavior on the Nodejitsu platform:

* *subdomain*: Specify the subdomain for your hosted app's Nodejitsu URL (for
  example, `subdomain.nodejitsu.com`.
* *domains*: A list of custom domains for your hosted app. See
  http://handbook.jitsu.com/features/dns.
* *env*: Specify environment variables for your app (for example,
  `NODE_ENV="production"` is set by default).
* *scripts.start*: This field is also used for `npm start`. However, Nodejitsu's
  current implementation takes a path, whereas npm's implementation takes a
  shell command.
* *analyze*: Set this to "false" to force jitsu to not analyze for the app's
  dependencies.
* *engine*: On Nodejitsu you can choose between different available node.js versions.
