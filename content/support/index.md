# Need Support?

Nodejitsu has a team of developers standing by to assist users with any issues
they may come across while deploying and administrating their web applications
on the Nodejitsu platform. Nodejitsu strives to have a lightning-fast turnaround
on all issues you may have!

The following can be extremely helpful for the support team if you have them
ahead of time:

1. username/appname.
2. A [gist](https://gist.github.com/) of your package.json file.
3. A [gist](https://gist.github.com/) of your command/action and error output.
4. Versions of tools and apps; `jitsu -v`, `node -v`, `npm -v`.
5. The platform you are working on -- Linux, Mac, Windows, etc.

## Github Issues

Each of Nodejitsu's open source projects uses Github Issues to manage bugs and
related software problems. Github Issues is most useful for developers. For
example, if a developer finds a bug in our open-source
[http proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy), they can submit an
issue at <https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues> and tell us about
their bug.
