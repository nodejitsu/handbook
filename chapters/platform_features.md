# Features of the Nodejitsu Platform
<a name='features'></a>

The Nodejitsu platform makes writing and deploying web applications a snap!
In addition to simple yet powerful tools for deployment, the Nodejitsu platform
also has snapshot management, database hosting and connectivity, and more!

There are three main tools for deploying applications to Nodejitsu:

* [Jitsu](#jitsu), The Nodejitsu command line tool 
* The Nodejitsu [Web Application](#web_admin), An easy to use web interface for
managing your applications
* Nodejitsu's JSON [API](#json_api)

Each of these tools allow developers to access the exact same functionality.

## Multi-Version node support

Nodejitsu allows users to choose which version of node they want their application to run on. This means that not only do we now support v0.6, but also that users may continue to use v0.4 if they would like.

In order to set your node version, specify it in your `package.json`'s "engines" field. For example:


    {
      "author": "Nodejitsu <josh@nodejitsu.com>",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node bin/server"
      },
      "analyze": false,
      "name": "helloworld",
      "engines": {
        "node": "v0.6.x"
      }
    }


If no node engine is specified, nodejitsu will default to v0.4.12.

## Snapshots
<a name='features/snapshots'></a>

Every time you deploy to Nodejitsu, we automatically take a
[snapshot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_\(computer_storage\)) of your
application. Using any of our tools, you can view and manage snapshots, or even
roll back to an old snapshot when disaster strikes in your production 
environment.

## Databases
<a name='features/databases'></a>

Applications on Nodejitsu are ready to be connected to any database. If you already have a database running, Nodejitsu can connect to your pre-existing database. If you require a new database, Nodejitsu can provide you *free* instances of several different types of databases. These free instances are great for development purposes or hobby sites. If you require a high traffic or production database we provide an easy upgrade path to industrial strength database hosting.

### Creating new Databases

If you require database hosting you can create a new database instance of any
of our supported databases using [jitsu](#jitsu) or Nodejitsu's [API](#api). Cloud database hosting is currently provided by IrisCouch, Redis2Go and MongoHQ.

### Existing Databases

If you already have an externally hosted Database, Nodejitsu is capable of
connecting to it. We've got Database hosting if you need it, but we fully
support externally hosted Databases.

### Connecting Applications to Databases

Whenever you create a database using Nodejitsu, you will be provided with all
the information you need to connect to your database. For instance, if you
`jitsu databases create mongo myMongo`, jitsu will tell you the url for your new
mongo database on mongohq:

    info:   Welcome to Nodejitsu
    info:   It worked if it ends with Nodejitsu ok
    info:   Executing command databases create mongo myMongo
    info:   Database myMongo was created.
    info:   Database name: myMongo
    info:   Database type: mongo
    info:   Connection url: mongodb://nodejitsu:pass@staff.mongohq.com:10057/
    info:   Nodejitsu ok

You can copy-paste this url directly into your mongo library's connect method.
For example, in [Mongoose](https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose/):

    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect("mongodb://nodejitsu:pass@staff.mongohq.com:10057/");


Now you're connected to your database!

## Environment Variable Management

Nodejitsu allows users to modify the environment variables exposed to their 
apps using jitsu and our other tools. When an environment variable is changed 
it is necessary restart your app for it to take effect.

Available commands are `list`, `get`, `set`, `delete`, and 
`clear`. 

`jitsu env list` will list any and all environment variables in an apps 
current working directory (Note: the app needs to have been deployed before the 
environment variables can be accessed).  
`jitsu env list <myapp>` will list any and all environment variables related 
to `<myapp>` in an account.  
`jitsu env get <key>` will display the apps key environment variable 
`<value>`.  
`jitsu env set <key> <value>` will set the apps `<key>` environment variable 
to `<value>`.  
`jitsu env get <key>` will delete the apps `<key>` environment variable.  
`jitsu env clear` will delete all of the apps environment variables after a 
prompt.

An Example:

    $ jitsu env set NODE_ENV production


This will set the environment variable $NODE_ENV to have the string value 
"production". Remember, this will not take effect until the app is restarted 
(`jitsu apps restart`).

## Addons

*Note: Coming soon!*

Addons add functionality to your apps by extending and adding features to
Nodejitsu's platform and integrating third party services. For instance,
one of our addons provides powerful [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com)-based
mailing list management.

## Marketplace

*Note: Coming soon!*

The Marketplace is an online store where you can browse ready to deploy
Node.js Applications. The Marketplace is a great place to start if you are new
to Node.js development or want to share your existing Node.js Application with
the world.
