# The Jitsu Client
<a name='jitsu'></a>

[Jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu) is a
[Command Line Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
(CLI) for interacting with the Nodejitsu platform. It's open-source and easy
to use.

## Installation

Jitsu is distributed using the Node Package Manager (npm). Installing jitsu
with npm is as simple as a single command:

     [sudo] npm install -g jitsu

This command installs jitsu to your Node path, so that it may be run like any other global shell command.

## Usage

Commands for jitsu follow this pattern:

    jitsu <resource> <action> <param1> <param2> ...

For example, in `jitsu apps deploy`, "apps" is the resource and "deploy" is the
action.

### jitsu deploy (jitsu apps deploy)

`jitsu deploy` will attempt to deploy the application in the current directory
to [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com). It deploys your application using the
following steps:

1. Creates the application (if necessary)
2. Creates or validates the package.json
3. Packages and creates a new snapshot
4. Stops the application (if necessary)
5. Starts the application

### jitsu create (jitsu apps create)

`jitsu create` will create a new application. This entails generating a
package.json for your app, for the purposes of deployment.

### jitsu list (jitsu apps list)

`jitsu list` lists your applications, as well as their respective states,
subdomains, entry points and latest snapshots.

### jitsu help <resource> <action>

*Jitsu is self-documenting.*
All commands will yield friendly messages to you if you specify incorrect
parameters. Additionally, `jitsu help` will return useful help messages about
any given resource or resource/action pair. for instance:

    josh@pidgey:~$ jitsu help apps deploy
    info:   Welcome to Nodejitsu
    info:   It worked if it ends with Nodejitsu ok
    info:   Executing command help apps deploy
    help:   
    help:   
    help:   Deploys an application using the following steps:
    help:   
    help:     1. Creates the application (if necessary)
    help:     2. Creates or validates the package.json
    help:     3. Packages and creates a new snapshot
    help:     4. Stops the application (if neccessary)
    help:     5. Starts the application
    help:   
    help:   jitsu deploy
    help:   jitsu apps deploy
    help:   
    info:   Nodejitsu ok
    josh@pidgey:~$ 

If no resource and/or action are specified, then `jitsu help` alone will
describe what resources are available.

### jitsu apps <action>

In addition to the commands aliased to `jitsu create`, `jitsu deploy` and 
`jitsu list`, the `apps` resource allows you to create, destroy, stop, start and
otherwise interact with your applications.

### jitsu env <action>

Jitsu allows you to set environment variables on your production environment.
For example, [Express](http://expressjs.com), a popular node.js web framework,
uses the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to change behavior based on whether the
environment is for development or production. In the case of Express, nodejitsu
has `NODE_ENV` set to "production" by default, but if one wanted to change this
variable or add more for their application, `jitsu env` supplies the tools to
do so.

### jitsu config <action>

`jitsu config` commands allow you to edit your local jitsu configuration file.

### jitsu snapshots <action>

`jitsu snapshots *` commands allow you to work with snapshots for your 
Applications on Nodejitsu. Snapshots are images of your Application's code that
are deployed to the Nodejitsu Platform.

For commands that take a `<name>` parameter, if no parameter is supplied,
jitsu will attempt to read the package.json from the current directory.

### jitsu users <action>

`jitsu users *` commands allow you to work with new or existing Nodejitsu user
accounts. You will be prompted for additional user information as required.


### jitsu install

`jitsu install` is a built-in tool for downloading "starter apps" to speed up development. For example, here's how to use `jitsu install` to download a "hello world" application:

    josh@onix:/tmp$ mkdir helloworld
    josh@onix:/tmp$ cd helloworld
    josh@onix:/tmp/helloworld$ jitsu install helloworld
    info:   Welcome to Nodejitsu
    info:   It worked if it ends with Nodejitsu ok
    info:   Executing command install helloworld
    info:   Installing helloworld locally.
    warn:   Downloading packages from npm, this may take a moment...
    info:   helloworld installed.
    help:   You can now jitsu deploy this application
    prompt: Would you like to start this application locally? (yes): no
    info:   Nodejitsu ok
    josh@onix:/tmp/helloworld$ ls
    bin  node_modules  package.json  ReadMe.md


## Configuring jitsu

All user-level configuration data for your local jitsu install is located in the *.jitsuconf* file located in your home directory. Directly modifying this file is not advised. You should be able to make all configuration changes using `jitsu config`.

### Selected Properties of .jitsuconf

* *loglength*: Change this to modify the default length of returned logs from `jitsu logs`.
* *loglevel*: Change this to modify the logging levels displayed by jitsu. Defaults to "info".
* *colors*: Change this to false to turn off jitsu's colors. Defaults to `true`.
* *analyze*: Change this to false to disable require-analyzer for all apps. Defaults to `true`.
