## Github Issues

Each of Nodejitsu's open source projects uses Github Issues to manage bugs and
related software problems. Github Issues is most useful for developers. For
example, if a developer finds a bug in our open-source
[http proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy), they can submit an
issue at <https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues> and tell us about
their bug.
