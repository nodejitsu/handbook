# JSON API
<a name='api'></a>

Nodejitsu provides a web API for developers who want to interact with the
Nodejitsu platform programatically. This API is built to be
[RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) and
communicates via [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). The API is the most
low-level way of interacting with the Nodejitsu platform. For most deployment
scenarios you should use our command line tool, [jitsu](#jitsu), or the
[online administrative interface](#webapp).

## API Clients

Nodejitsu has a JSON API client for node.js, which may be found [here](https://github.com/nodejitsu/nodejitsu-api) (along with API clients in other languages as they are developed). Jitsu is implemented by using the node.js API client.

## Authentication 

Most of the calls to the API will require that you authenticate using your Nodejitsu account. If you do not have an account it is possible to create one using the API, the [jitsu CLI](#jitsu), or just by visiting [http://nodejitsu.com](http://nodejitsu.com). Currently, we support [Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). If you haven't used Basic Auth before, don't fret; it's easy! 

Here is an example using the command line utility,
[Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/):

     // get all applications for User "Marak"
     curl --user Marak:password http://api.nodejitsu.com/apps/marak

## Applications

Applications are the core of the Nodejitsu API. Each application represents a set of Node.js code plus a package.json which contains meta-data about the application such as it's dependencies, database connections, configuration settings and authors. For more information about the package.json format see: [package.json](#package_json)

### Get all Applications for a User
    
     GET /apps/:user-id

     POST /apps/:user-id/:app-id/start

### Stop an Application
     
     POST /apps/:user-id/:app-id/stop

### Restart an Application
     
     POST /apps/:user-id/:app-id/restart

### Update an Application

     PUT /apps/:user-id
     { package.json }

### Delete an Application
